# Scratch 2 Unity From Tampermonkey  

Attempt to export the variable of Scratch to Unity from the use of Tampermonkey.  

I saw that Tamper Monkey is used by hacking software to extract data and 3D mesh of website.  
So I suppose we can use it to extract the var of Scratch Edu.  

Let's try to learn the device and find how we can use it to scrap the variable.  

The hack attempt aim to allows Scratch users to play outside of scratch without having some stress of the Scratch server.  
And the goal is to allows to learn code in scratch by playing game in Unity3D.
